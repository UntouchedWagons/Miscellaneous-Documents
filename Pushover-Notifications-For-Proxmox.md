Use `"priority": "2",` and add the following (refer to Pushover documentation for what these settings do):
JSON:

```
"retry": "30",
"expire": "300",
"tags": "service=pve-emergency",
```

I haven't quite got emergency to work. The first message is sent out, but then subsequent emergency messages are not received. I suspect the Pushover API requires the emergency to be cancelled first before subsequent emergency notifications are received by Pushover from the same host. I don't think Proxmox can be configured to send a subsequent cancel by tag notification once the status changes to resolved (I added the "tags": "service=pve-emergency", to set a tag so that a manual cancel by tag is possible and it therefore isn't strictly necessary for emergency messages).

Others
You can use other optional Pushover API parametes such as device, sound, url, url_title and html by specifying them in the JSON format within the body.
